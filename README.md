# SliderCrank_Mechanism
A slider-crank mechanism is the arrangement of mechanical parts designed to convert straight-line motion to rotary motion, as in a reciprocating piston engine, or to convert rotary motion to straight-line motion, as in a reciprocating piston pump.

### Used:
- MatLab
- Simulink
- Simscape Multibody

### Block Diagram:

### Specs:
- Distance of piston from ground = 2.0 cm
- r2 = 5.0 cm
- r3 = 8.0 cm
- All desnties = 1000 kg/m^3
- Rotational speed = 30 rad/sec

### Simulation Output:
- Average speed of slider to the right: 2.2699 m/sec
- Average speed of slider to the left: 1.593 m/sec
- The time ratio between the left and right motions: lt = 0.108sec, rt = 0.194sec time ratio = 0.108/0.194 = 0.5567
